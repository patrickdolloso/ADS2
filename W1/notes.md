## Weeks 1 & 2: Analysis of Algorithms
### Key concepts
* Theoretical vs. empirical algorithm analysis
* Memory and time requirements from
pseudocode
* Growth function and asymptotic notation

## Video 1.001 What is analysis of algorithms?
### Possible aspects to analyse:
* Correctness
* Ease of understanding
  * functions that implement specific algos are usually part of much bigger programs that need to be updated/maintained by different people at different times 
* Resource Consumption
  *  When executed, algorithms use processing and memory resources. They might also need bandwidth. Algorithms that perform their tasks correctly with the lowest resource consumption are naturally better candidates than those requiring more resources.When executed, algorithms use processing and memory resources. They might also need bandwidth. Algorithms that perform their tasks correctly with the lowest resource consumption are naturally better candidates than those requiring more resources.
*  We will focus on processing and memory resources
### Processing
* Processing requirements are usually measured in terms of the number of operations the central processing unit must carry out to execute the algorithm.
* The # of operations is important because the lower the number of operations, the faster the algo
### Memory Requirements
* Memory requirements are measured in terms of the number of memory positions required by the algorithm during its execution.
* Memory is also relevant because we have to make sure our algorithm requires an amount of memory that is well under the capacity of current computers.
### By the end of this topic, you will answer:
* How many operations does this algorithm take? 
* How much memory does this algorithm require?
* Which algorithm do you recommend for this task?

### 2.2 Analyzing algos
Paragraph 1, Sec 2.2, (p.23):
* Analyzing an algo has come to mean predicting resources that the algo requires
* Ocasionally, resources such as memory, communication bandwidthm or computer hardware are of primary concern (most often it is computational time)
